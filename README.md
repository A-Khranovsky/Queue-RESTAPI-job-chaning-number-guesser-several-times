# Queue-RESTAPI-job-chaning-number-guesser-several-times
Web application tries to guess a number using a chain of jobs in a queue many times by genereting a random number. It equals a genereted number and a number has configured. If number is not guessed the job returns to queue once again and it will be continued for a number of tries has configured. 
App uses RESTAPI to: direct it, input parameters, get result info, get log info.
(Used docker configuration info from user 'sagar290', thanks to him).

## Endpoints:  
* GET http://localhost:80/api/app/start  
Starts app with the default settings (from .env). Can receive paramaters(all or their combinations):  
  * links=x, x is number of chain's links  
  * tries=x, x is number of tries in all the chain's links
  * guess_number=x, x is number app will try to guess in all the chain's links
  * range[start]=x&range[end]=y, x and y is numbers describes start of the range and end respectively
    
* GET http://localhost:80/api/app/logs
Outputs history of trying guess process. Can receive a parameter:
  * transaction=x, where x is number of transaction you want to see.
    
* GET http://localhost:80/api/total
Outputs result of the guessing process paramters that has used, time of start, end and time was spend.
  
* GET http://localhost:80/api/result 
Outputs simple guessing process.
  
* GET http://localhost:80/api/app/logs/clear
Clear all the logs
```
Default settings:  
    Links count = 2
    Tries = 100
    Guess number = 50
    Range start = 0
    Range end = 100
```
